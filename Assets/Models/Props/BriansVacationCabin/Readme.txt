Brian's Vacation Cabin
V1.0

Thank you for purchasing Brian's Vacation Cabin.

Find both prefabs in the root folder, set up with colliders.

The difference between the two different models are;
 - Top-down view model has the door frames merged together with the house mesh, and hidden faces are removed
 - It also has extra faces, closing the wall tops, and it has the roof/ceiling merged together and can be removed simply 
 - FPS view has faces on the walls by the door frames, so you can move/remove the doors/frames, everything else is merged together.


Happy game developing!
