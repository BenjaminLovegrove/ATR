A cloud of floating dust particle motes to add atmosphere to your environment.

Simply load the example Floating_Dust_Particles.unity scene, or drag the Floating_Dust_Particles.prefab from the Prefabs folder into the Hierarchy window.

To tweak the effect settings then select it in the Hierarchy window and the particle parameters will be available to you in the Inspector window (on the right). The effect scale can be altered by changing the shape of the Box under the "Shape" settings. Note that to keep the particle density the same you'll want to alter the Rate (under "Emission") to keep in at the same ratio, ie if you double the width of the box then also double the particle count.

Have fun!
